          Frequently, conversations regarding systemic racism and racial
          discrimination direct their attention toward America's moral failures
          in pursuit of "freedom" through power and supremacy, resulting in the
          production of repetitive discourses that overlook the very deliberate
          forms of violence and punishment inflicted on many of its own
          populations. America's urban centers have often been fancied as
          opportunistic spaces accessible to all who are willing to put in the
          work, continuing to propagate the American opus of a "land of the free
          and home of the brave", yet, analyses of the urban experience in major
          cities across the nation unveils imbalances in health, wealth,
          housing, environmental justice and a plethora of public policy issues
          sustaining a cycle of unjust suffering. Collectively, we must
          acknowledge that condemnations of bad ethics and moral failings are
          inadequate bases for reform and our attention must be concerted
          towards the very real ways policy and infrastructure decisions
          actively direct various forms of violence on disenfranchised
          populations.

          Critical in conversations concerning discriminatory urban policymaking
          is the evolution of historically and culturally significant Baltimore,
          Maryland. Birthplace of both "The Star-Spangled Banner" and Peabody
          Award winning TV series "The Wire", Baltimore exists in a state of
          disquieting juxtapositions evident in its socioeconomic reality just
          as much as its culture contributions. Originating as a key seaport
          city due to its access to the Chesapeake Bay, its crux as a city of
          trade, commerce, and industrialization has greatly shaped this "city
          of firsts", however, my attention will be concentrated on how it being
          the first in the country to pass a residential segregation ordinance
          as part of its redlining experiment has created a legacy of inequality
          and violence while setting a precedent for racial containment and
          segregationist urban policy for cities throughout the nation. The 1910
          ordinance was passed as retaliatory policy in response to the
          ineffectiveness of racial violence to prevent encroachment of the
          black population into white neighborhoods, so when it was eventually
          ruled unconstitutional, zoning and other forms of legal segregation
          replaced the ordinance in order to sustain the objective of racial
          containment. Redlining resulting in lack of investment and active
          disenfranchisement of majority black neighborhoods has also
          exacerbated social and economic barriers to the extent that such
          factors are observable in modern health outcomes. Here I will attempt
          to map such health disparities in congruence with existing research
          examining social and economic inequalities.

          Successful in it's institutionalized segregation, the 13% of Baltimore
          graded "hazardous" by the Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the
          1930s is also home to most of the 19% of Baltimore's black population
          — one of America's largest urban African American populations. In a
          study by Shuo Jim Huang and Neil Jay Sehgal wherein they examined this
          historical redlining in relation to health outcomes at a community
          statistical level in modern Baltimore with attention to health
          indicators like life expectancy, child health, and age-differentiated
          mortality using map transformations, overlay, and analysis
          establishing a correlation between the HOLC's security maps and health
          disparities across communities. Huang writes, "Even after controlling
          for racial composition and median household income, CSAs that were
          categorized as red or yellow had a 5-year shorter life expectancy than
          CSAs that had been categorized as green or blue", also noting that
          "people living in redlined neighborhoods had less access to green
          spaces [32] and physical activity that might have an impact on the
          prevention and management of chronic conditions [6]." There is also
          significance in Huang's acknowledgment that lifelong engagement with
          racism and systemic hostility can also contribute to these negative
          health outcomes [2,5]. Although there are limitations to this research
          due to time constraints, clearly there is a correlation between the
          HOLC's security maps and CSA grades to life expectancy and health
          disparities, warranting a more intense evaluation of the relationship
          between security maps to policymaking and infrastructure affecting
          Baltimorean health.

          According to the 2013 Baltimore City Health Disparities Report Card
          which studied Baltimoreans making less than $75,000 yearly, black men
          and women suffered from cardiovascular disease mortality at increased
          rates than white men and women in Baltimore (7). Additionally, black
          Baltimoreans mental health suffered 1.82% more than white Baltimorean,
          also reporting 1.62% unmet healthcare needs than their white
          counterparts. One third of Baltimore households earn less than $25,000
          which significantly limits access to care, housing, healthy food
          options, and a host of socioeconomic obstacles that can worsen health
          outcomes without even factoring in drug use and violent victimization.
          Culminating this report card is the map of Avertable Premature Deaths,
          which represents the amount of deaths before the age of 75 in
          Baltimore that could have been avoided if every neighborhood had equal
          health opportunities under the premise of the CSA's with the highest
          median incomes being achievable in every community. In summary, 26 of
          the 49 CSAs (53%) with median household incomes <$75,000 per year, at
          least 50% of deaths could be avertable (17).

          This report was done in 2013 but we continue to observe how
          disproportionate access to health opportunities wreak havoc on
          majority black communities, especially notable in the tragic and
          disproportionate loss of life among black populations during the
          COVID-19 pandemic — a true exposition of just how disparate these
          inequalities are. Considering the health disparities present during
          non-disaster times, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated health risk
          factors on black populations in the form of psychological distress in
          the form of acute and chronic stress, depression, and anxiety worsened
          by in access to essential resources, information, healthcare bias, and
          increased mortality in the community. In a 2021 study examining this
          intersection of mental health stressors on black populations and
          increased cardiovascular disease during the pandemic, "depressive
          symptoms noted among Blacks during the pandemic include, but are not
          limited to anger, chronic stress, anxiety, and fear for personal and
          familial health and wellbeing. During times of increased stress, the
          adrenergic system is activated, leading to increased systemic
          inflammation, exacerbating underlying CVD, increasing the risk of
          adverse cardiovascular events (Sims et al., 2020; Yancy, 2020)". This
          study in conjunction with the 2013 Report Card stating that black men
          and women in Baltimore suffered from increased cardiovascular disease
          than whites and the assertion that poorly graded CSAs suffer from
          broad scale health inequalities warrants and intensive analysis of the
          structural obstacles preventing black Baltimoreans from receiving the
          care they need. The psychological stressors of racism and hostile
          policy cannot be reduced to a moral shortcoming, but must be
          interrogated as a structural failure.

        <p>
          The legacy of segregation and institutional racism left by the HOCL's
          security maps have contained Baltimore's black and minority population
          in a manner akin to caging animals in a zoo, limiting black residency
          to the inner city and de-industrialized areas in the physical scope,
          which has festered a plethora of socioeconomic issues that need
          rectifying. However, the undeniable truth of disparate health outcomes
          throughout Baltimore's populations and neighborhoods in correlation to
          the last century's redlining is a necessary confrontation of the
          direct harm and violence racist and neglectful urban policymaking has
          on human quality of life. Reassessing zoning policy in urban planning
          and rectify the harm done by redlining is essential in creating a
          healthier Baltimore.
