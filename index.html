                    <p>
                        Frequently, conversations regarding systemic racism and racial discrimination direct their
                        attention
                        toward America’s moral failures in pursuit of “freedom” through power and supremacy, resulting
                        in
                        repetitive discourses that overlook deliberate forms of violence and punishment inflicted on
                        many of
                        its own populations. America’s urban centers have often been imagined as opportunistic spaces
                        accessible to all who are willing to put in the work, continuing to propagate the national opus
                        of a
                        “land of the free and home of the brave,” yet analyses of the urban experience in major cities
                        unveil
                        imbalances in health, wealth, housing, environmental justice, and a host of public policy issues
                        sustaining a cycle of unjust suffering.

                    <p>
                        Condemnations of bad ethics and moral failings are inadequate bases for reform. Our attention
                        must be
                        directed toward the concrete ways policy and infrastructure decisions actively channel violence
                        onto
                        disenfranchised populations.

                                Central to conversations concerning discriminatory urban policymaking is the evolution
                                of
                                historically and culturally significant Baltimore, Maryland. Birthplace of both “The
                                Star-Spangled Banner” and the Peabody Award–winning TV series

                                exists in disquieting juxtapositions evident in its socioeconomic reality just as much
                                as its
                                cultural contributions.

                                Originating as a key seaport city due to access to the Chesapeake Bay, its crux as a
                                city of
                                trade, commerce, and industrialization has greatly shaped this “city of firsts.”
                                However, my
                                attention is concentrated on how its being the first U.S. city to pass a residential
                                segregation ordinance as part of a redlining experiment created a legacy of inequality
                                and
                                violence while setting a precedent for racial containment and segregationist urban
                                policy
                                nationwide.

                            The 1910 ordinance was passed as retaliatory policy in response to the ineffectiveness of
                            racial
                            violence in preventing the encroachment of Black residents into white neighborhoods. When
                            the
                            ordinance was eventually ruled unconstitutional, zoning and other legal mechanisms replaced
                            it
                            to sustain racial containment. Redlining—through disinvestment and disenfranchisement of
                            majority-Black neighborhoods—exacerbated social and economic barriers to the extent that
                            such
                            factors are observable in modern health outcomes.

                            The 13% of Baltimore graded “hazardous” by the HOLC in the 1930s is also home to much of the
                            city’s Black population—one of the largest urban African American populations in the U.S. In
                            a
                            study by Shuo Jim Huang and Neil Jay Sehgal, historical HOLC grades were related to
                            present-day
                            community statistical areas (CSAs) and health indicators like life expectancy, child health,
                            and
                            mortality. Their analysis established a correlation between HOLC “security” maps and
                            contemporary health disparities.

                            categorized as red or yellow had a 5-year shorter life expectancy than CSAs categorized as
                            green
                            or blue.” Residents of redlined neighborhoods also had less access to green spaces and
                            physical
                            activity—factors tied to prevention and management of chronic disease. Lifelong exposure to

                            Baltimoreans earning under $75,000 annually, Black men and women suffered higher
                            cardiovascular
                            disease mortality than white residents. Black Baltimoreans also reported 1.82% higher burden

                            poor mental health and 1.62% more unmet healthcare needs. One third of households earn under

                            Though the report card predates COVID-19, the pandemic exposed how inequitable access to
                            health
                            opportunities devastates majority-Black communities. Pre-existing disparities intensified:
                            stress, depression, and anxiety rose alongside barriers to resources, unbiased care, and
                            information—contributing to elevated mortality.

                            A 2021 study reported that Black populations during the pandemic experienced depressive
                            symptoms including anger, chronic stress, anxiety, and fear for health. Heightened stress
                            exacerbates cardiovascular risk, compounding Baltimore’s disparities and underscoring the
                            need
                            to address structural—not moral—failures that impede care.

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    Historical redlining in Baltimore created enduring health disparities that persist nearly a century
                    later. Addressing these inequities demands targeted public health interventions and structural
                    reforms
                    that engage root causes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommended actions include: investing in healthcare infrastructure in formerly redlined
                    neighborhoods,
                    funding community health programs that address social determinants, expanding high-quality green
                    spaces, and advancing equitable development policies that avoid displacement.

                            As an anthropology student with a focus on urban studies and social inequality, I study how
                            historical policies continue to shape contemporary communities. This research reflects a
                            commitment to using anthropological methods to illuminate the lasting impacts of structural
                            racism on public health.
