                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Frequently, conversations regarding systemic racism and racial discrimination direct their
                        attention toward America's moral failures in pursuit of "freedom" through power and supremacy.
                        This has resulted in repetitive discourses that often overlook the very deliberate forms of
                        violence and punishment inflicted on many of its own populations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        America's urban centers have often been imagined as opportunistic spaces accessible to all who
                        are willing to put in the work. This narrative continues to propagate the American ideal of a
                        "land of the free and home of the brave." Yet, an analysis of the urban experience in major
                        cities across the nation reveals deep imbalances in health, wealth, housing, environmental
                        justice, and a range of public policy issues that sustain a cycle of unjust suffering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Collectively, we must acknowledge that condemnations of bad ethics and moral failings are
                        inadequate bases for reform. Our focus must be directed instead toward the very real ways policy
                        and infrastructure decisions actively perpetuate forms of violence against disenfranchised
                        populations.

                                    evolution of historically and culturally significant Baltimore, Maryland.
                                    Birthplace of both "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the Peabody Award-winning
                                    TV series "The Wire," Baltimore exists in a state of disquieting juxtapositions
                                    evident in its socioeconomic fabric.

                    <p>
                        Using GIS mapping technology, this study overlayed 1937 HOLC redlining maps with contemporary
                        health data from the
                        Baltimore City Health Department. The analysis included life expectancy, infant mortality rates,
                        prevalence of chronic
                        diseases, and healthcare access metrics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key findings reveal that neighborhoods graded "D" (hazardous) by HOLC in 1937 continue to
                        experience significantly
                        worse health outcomes, including 15% higher rates of diabetes, 22% higher rates of heart
                        disease, and reduced access
                        to quality healthcare facilities compared to areas originally graded "A" or "B".

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    The evidence clearly demonstrates that historical redlining practices in Baltimore created enduring
                    health disparities
                    that persist nearly 90 years later. These findings underscore the need for targeted public health
                    interventions and
                    policy reforms that address the root causes of health inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommendations include increased investment in healthcare infrastructure in formerly redlined
                    neighborhoods, community
                    health programs that address social determinants of health, and policies that promote equitable
                    development without
                    displacement of existing residents.

                            As an anthropology student with a focus on urban studies and social inequality, I am
                            passionate about
                            understanding how historical policies continue to shape contemporary communities. This
                            research represents my
                            commitment to using anthropological methods to illuminate the lasting impacts of structural
                            racism on public
                            health outcomes.
