                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Frequently, conversations regarding systemic racism and racial discrimination direct their
                        attention toward America’s moral failures in pursuit of “freedom” through power and supremacy,
                        resulting in repetitive discourses that overlook deliberate forms of violence and punishment
                        inflicted on many of its own populations. America’s urban centers have often been imagined as
                        opportunistic spaces accessible to all who are willing to put in the work, continuing to
                        propagate the national opus of a “land of the free and home of the brave.” Yet analyses of the
                        urban experience across major cities unveil imbalances in health, wealth, housing, environmental
                        justice, and a host of public policy issues that sustain a cycle of unjust suffering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Condemnations of bad ethics and moral failings are inadequate bases for reform. Our attention
                        must be directed toward the concrete ways policy and infrastructure decisions actively channel
                        violence onto disenfranchised populations.

                            <p>
                                Central to conversations about discriminatory urban policymaking is the evolution of
                                historically and culturally significant Baltimore, Maryland. Birthplace of both “The
                                Star-Spangled Banner” and the Peabody Award–winning TV series <em>The Wire</em>,
                                Baltimore exists in disquieting juxtapositions evident in its socioeconomic reality as
                                much as its cultural contributions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Originating as a key seaport city due to access to the Chesapeake Bay, Baltimore’s roles
                                in trade, commerce, and industrialization have shaped this “city of firsts.” My focus,
                                however, is on its being the first U.S. city to pass a residential segregation ordinance
                                as part of a redlining experiment—creating a legacy of inequality and violence and
                                setting a precedent for racial containment and segregationist urban policy nationwide.

                        <p>
                            The 1910 ordinance was enacted as retaliatory policy in response to the ineffectiveness of
                            racial violence at preventing the encroachment of Black residents into white neighborhoods.
                            When the ordinance was eventually ruled unconstitutional, zoning and other legal mechanisms
                            replaced it to sustain racial containment. Redlining—through disinvestment and active
                            disenfranchisement of majority-Black neighborhoods—exacerbated social and economic barriers
                            to the point that these factors are observable in modern health outcomes.

                        <h3>Historic Grades, Present Outcomes</h3>
                        <p>
                            Through institutionalized segregation, the 13% of Baltimore graded “hazardous” by the HOLC
                            in the 1930s overlaps with much of the city’s Black population—one of the largest urban
                            African American communities in the U.S. In a study by Shuo Jim Huang and Neil Jay Sehgal,
                            historical HOLC grades were related to present-day community statistical areas (CSAs) and
                            health indicators such as life expectancy, child health, and age-differentiated mortality.
                            Using map transformations, overlays, and statistical analysis, they established a clear
                            correlation between HOLC “security” maps and contemporary health disparities across
                            communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Huang notes: “Even after controlling for racial composition and median household income,
                            CSAs categorized as red or yellow had a 5-year shorter life expectancy than CSAs categorized
                            as green or blue,” adding that residents in redlined neighborhoods have reduced access to
                            green spaces and physical activity—factors closely tied to chronic disease prevention and
                            management. Lifelong exposure to racism and systemic hostility further contributes to
                            adverse health outcomes. Although this project’s scope has limits, the correlation between
                            HOLC grades and life expectancy warrants deeper evaluation of how security maps shape policy
                            and infrastructure affecting Baltimorean health.

                        <h3>Quantifying the Impact</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to the <em>Baltimore City Health Disparities Report Card (2013)</em>, among
                            Baltimoreans earning under $75,000 annually, Black men and women suffered higher
                            cardiovascular disease mortality than white residents. Black Baltimoreans also reported
                            1.82% higher burden of poor mental health and 1.62% more unmet healthcare needs compared to
                            white Baltimoreans. One third of households earn under $25,000—a constraint that limits
                            access to care, housing, and healthy food options, compounding risk even before accounting
                            for substance use or violent victimization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The report’s map of <em>Avertable Premature Deaths</em> estimates the deaths before age 75
                            that could have been avoided if every neighborhood enjoyed equal health opportunity
                            comparable to the CSAs with the highest median incomes. In 26 of 49 CSAs (53%) with median
                            incomes under $75,000, at least half of premature deaths were potentially avertable.

                        <h3>The Pandemic's Disproportionate Toll</h3>
                        <p>
                            Though the report card predates COVID-19, the pandemic laid bare how inequitable access to
                            health opportunities devastates majority-Black communities. Pre-existing disparities
                            intensified: acute and chronic stress, depression, and anxiety rose alongside barriers in
                            access to resources, information, and unbiased care—contributing to elevated mortality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A 2021 study on Black populations during the pandemic reported depressive symptoms including
                            anger, chronic stress, anxiety, and fear for personal and familial health. Heightened stress
                            activates adrenergic pathways and systemic inflammation, exacerbating underlying
                            cardiovascular disease and increasing the risk of adverse events (Sims et al., 2020; Yancy,
                            2020). Coupled with Baltimore’s documented disparities, this nexus underscores the need to
                            interrogate structural—not moral—failures that impede care.

                    <p>
                        While this project’s constraints limit exhaustive analysis, the converging evidence—historical
                        HOLC grades, present-day CSA health metrics, and socio-environmental indicators—supports a
                        robust correlation between redlining and poor health. These patterns justify deeper evaluation
                        of how past mapping practices continue to steer contemporary policymaking and infrastructure in

                        In short: neighborhoods graded “D” (hazardous) by HOLC continue to experience markedly worse
                        outcomes, including higher burdens of chronic disease and reduced access to health-promoting
                        resources, compared with areas historically graded “A” or “B.”

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    Historical redlining in Baltimore created enduring health disparities that persist nearly a century
                    later. Addressing these inequities demands targeted public health interventions and structural
                    policy reforms that engage root causes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommended actions include: investing in healthcare infrastructure in formerly redlined
                    neighborhoods; funding community health programs that address social determinants (housing, food
                    access, environmental quality); expanding high-quality green space and safe physical-activity
                    corridors; and advancing equitable development policies that avoid displacing existing residents.

                            As an anthropology student with a focus on urban studies and social inequality, I study how
                            historical policies continue to shape contemporary communities. This research reflects a
                            commitment to using anthropological methods to illuminate the lasting impacts of structural
                            racism on public health.
