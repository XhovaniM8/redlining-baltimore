                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>
                        Frequently, conversations regarding systemic racism and racial discrimination direct their
                        attention toward America's moral failures in pursuit of "freedom" through power and supremacy,
                        resulting in the production of repetitive discourses that overlook the very deliberate forms of
                        violence and punishment inflicted on many of its own populations. America's urban centers have
                        often been fancied as opportunistic spaces accessible to all who are willing to put in the work,
                        continuing to propagate the American opus of a "land of the free and home of the brave", yet,
                        analyses of the urban experience in major cities across the nation unveils imbalances in health,
                        wealth, housing, environmental justice and a plethora of public policy issues sustaining a cycle
                        of unjust suffering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Collectively, we must acknowledge that condemnations of bad ethics and moral failings are
                        inadequate bases for reform and our attention must be concerted towards the very real ways
                        policy and infrastructure decisions actively direct various forms of violence on
                        disenfranchised populations.

                            <p>
                                Critical in conversations concerning discriminatory urban policymaking is the
                                evolution of historically and culturally significant Baltimore, Maryland.
                                Birthplace of both "The Star-Spangled Banner" and Peabody Award winning TV series "The
                                Wire",
                                Baltimore exists in a state of disquieting juxtapositions evident in its socioeconomic
                                reality
                                just as much as its culture contributions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Originating as a key seaport city due to its access to the Chesapeake
                                Bay, its crux as a city of trade, commerce, and industrialization has greatly shaped
                                this "city
                                of firsts", however, my attention will be concentrated on how it being the first in the
                                country
                                to pass a residential segregation ordinance as part of its redlining experiment has
                                created a
                                legacy of inequality and violence while setting a precedent for racial containment and
                                segregationist urban policy for cities throughout the nation.

                        <h3>The Origins of Systematic Segregation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The 1910 ordinance was passed as retaliatory policy in response to the ineffectiveness of
                            racial
                            violence to prevent encroachment of the black population into white neighborhoods, so when
                            it was
                            eventually ruled unconstitutional, zoning and other forms of legal segregation replaced the
                            ordinance
                            in order to sustain the objective of racial containment. Redlining resulting in lack of
                            investment and
                            active disenfranchisement of majority black neighborhoods has also exacerbated social and
                            economic barriers to the extent that such factors are observable in modern health outcomes.

                            Huang writes, "Even after controlling for racial composition and median household income,
                            CSAs that
                            were categorized as red or yellow had a 5-year shorter life expectancy than CSAs that had
                            been
                            categorized as green or blue", also noting that "people living in redlined neighborhoods had
                            less

                            that
                            lifelong engagement with racism and systemic hostility can also contribute to these negative

                            According to the 2013 Baltimore City Health Disparities Report Card which studied
                            Baltimoreans
                            making less than $75,000 yearly, black men and women suffered from cardiovascular disease
                            mortality at increased rates than white men and women in Baltimore. Additionally, black
                            Baltimoreans mental health suffered 1.82% more than white Baltimorean, also reporting 1.62%
                            unmet healthcare needs than their white counterparts. One third of Baltimore households earn
                            less than $25,000 which significantly limits access to care, housing, healthy food options,
                            and
                            a host of socioeconomic obstacles that can worsen health outcomes without even factoring in
                            drug

                    <h3>Methodology & Findings</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although there are limitations to this research due to time constraints, clearly there is a
                        correlation between the HOLC's security maps and CSA grades to life expectancy and health
                        disparities, warranting a more intense evaluation of the relationship between security maps to
                        policymaking and infrastructure affecting Baltimorean health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key findings reveal that neighborhoods graded "D" (hazardous) by HOLC in 1937 continue to
                        experience significantly worse health outcomes, including 15% higher rates of diabetes, 22%
                        higher rates of heart disease, and reduced access to quality healthcare facilities compared to
                        areas originally graded "A" or "B".

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    The evidence clearly demonstrates that historical redlining practices in Baltimore created enduring
                    health disparities that persist nearly 90 years later. These findings underscore the need for
                    targeted public health interventions and policy reforms that address the root causes of health
                    inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommendations include increased investment in healthcare infrastructure in formerly redlined
                    neighborhoods, community health programs that address social determinants of health, and policies
                    that promote equitable development without displacement of existing residents.

                            As an anthropology student with a focus on urban studies and social inequality, I am
                            passionate about understanding how historical policies continue to shape contemporary
                            communities. This research represents my commitment to using anthropological methods to
                            illuminate the lasting impacts of structural racism on public health outcomes.
